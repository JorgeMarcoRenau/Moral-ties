# Abstract                                                                                                                                         
We present an analytical framework for studying the influence of networks on the adherence to social norms as a
result of peer pressure. We introduce a new concept, termed moral ties, that combines the agentsâ€™ actions with
network metrics and allows quantifying the capacity of agents to exercise and coordinate peer pressure. The 
effects of moral ties on peer pressure are non-linear and independent from group size. Only isomorphic networks
with respect to moral ties present identical peer pressure. We signpost the minimal and maximal effects of moral
ties on peer pressure for networks of any topology and size and discuss policy implications for the promotion           
of social norms.
